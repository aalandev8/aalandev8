# üë®‚Äçüíª Hi! I'm Facundo Duque.
Uruguayan programmer with a journey from frontend to backend. Passionate about merging both for robust development. Committed to daily learning and improvement

# üí´ About Me:
Since I was young, I've always been passionate about technology. At the age of 8, I received my first PC, and that sparked my interest in exploring the fascinating world of technology.

During my adolescence, I pursued a computer science program in high school, immersing myself in everything related to programming. I vividly recall my first programming language being Java.

After completing high school, I delved into various personal projects until I stumbled upon the world of Blockchain. This discovery further fueled my passion for programming, prompting me to delve into solidity development and enhance my web development skills, both front-end and back-end. I learned Javascript, Typescript, and Nextjs, among other essential tools that remain integral to my daily routine as a developer.
